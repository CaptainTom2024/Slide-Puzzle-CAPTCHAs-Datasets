# Notch Detection Datasets (ND-Datasets) and Two-Dimensional Sliding Trajectory Datasets (2D-ST-Datasets)

## Introduction

- This is the datasets constructed in our paper "SPC-GAN-Attack: Attacking Slide Puzzle CAPTCHAs by Human-Like Sliding Trajectories Based on Generative Adversarial Network".
- For each type of slide puzzle CAPTCHA, we download 500 background images by a crawler, and manually label the notches in the background images to construct the ND-Dataset.
- For each type of slide puzzle CAPTCHA, we collect 500 verified  human two-dimensional sliding trajectories to construct the 2D-ST-Dataset.
